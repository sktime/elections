# :postbox: 2024 `sktime` council elections

:mega: `sktime` is holding its first set of community council elections!

* :sunny: We believe in open source and open science. We think AI technology - especially open source - should be openly governed.

* :statue_of_liberty: Open governance means: any contributor has the right to participate in governance and decision making.
Eligibility is defined by merit, not place of birth, social class, or connectedness to majority demographic entrepeneurship networks.

* :tophat: :moneybag: Not all open source is openly governed. Many open source projects are run closed by companies, taking advantage of contributors for the benefit of a small group of individuals.

:globe_with_meridians: `sktime` takes inspiration from Wikipedia, and aspires to become an open knowledge hub, providing opportunities to everyone.

## What positions are open?

All seven seats on the community council are open for election:

* four of the seats for election by all contributors
* three of the seats for election by the current council

The above is a variant of opening four seats, with three seats in continuity with the current council.

As this is the first cohort of elected councilors, tenure for the open positions will vary between 1 and 3 years. In particular there will be:

* 3 seats open with a 3-year tenure.
* 2 seats open with a 2-year tenure. 
* 2 seats open with a 1-year tenure.

See [detail description here](https://github.com/sktime/elections/blob/main/provisions/elections-council-2024.md#seats-and-voting-algorithm).

## What are the rights and duties of councilors?

The community council is the primary executive body of the sktime project, councilors decide on matters such as project direction or financials, subject to the sktime [mission](https://www.sktime.net/en/stable/about/mission.html)
and [code of conduct](https://www.sktime.net/en/stable/get_involved/code_of_conduct.html).

Details on [`sktime` governance here](https://www.sktime.net/en/stable/get_involved/governance.html)

A key expectation is that councilors will proactively contribute to the widening of `sktime`'s governance model and charitable mission.

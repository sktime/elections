## About me

I am Felix Hirwa Nshuti, a Computer Science and Engineering student from India at Pandit Deendayal Energy University. I have a passion for open-source and believe that it is the quickest and easiest way to contribute to the technology that has a real-time impact. When there is advocacy for an open-source project, it gets high reach and attracts smart minds to contribute to strengthening the existing project. My belief in collaborative work makes me want to engage more in sktime development activities.

## Goals

If elected, my goal is to continue the sktime development mission by engaging in community activities, contributing to decision-making to keep sktime goals alive, and participating in mentorship activities that help different contributors to onboard sktime.

I plan to be a good ambassador and present sktime to all my capabilities through presenting sktime in different schools in Rwanda where I will be headed after graduating with my undergraduate degree. I want to be a voice of sktime in the African region.

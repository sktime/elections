# sktime Candidate Statement - Ugochukwu Onyeka (Treasurer)

Over the years, I have been enamoured of the open-source ecosystem. One of the things I love about open-source is that it provides an opportunity for people from diverse backgrounds and creeds to build tools that help many people lead better and more productive lives under the auspices of community leaders, mentors, and selfless individuals who provide guidance and direction for the community.

Before joining sktime’s transitional council as treasurer, I had been a community lead and advocate in various developer or software user groups. sktime provided me with an opportunity to contribute to open source development in a higher capacity, being saddled with the responsibility of working with other council members to pilot the affairs of sktime over the past year. 

I seek to continue in my role as the treasurer for sktime for another term. I am still as dedicated as ever to the vision and ideals of sktime and possess the required skill to ensure sktime’s financial transactions are duly reported in line with extant regulations and standards. I will continue to bring my years of experience (over a decade of running a private bookkeeping practice as a Chartered Accountant) to the fore to ensure sktime’s progress and the attainment of its corporate goal: to be the platform that unifies all of Python’s time series tools.

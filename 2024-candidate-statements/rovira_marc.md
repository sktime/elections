# Candidate Statement for Marc Rovira for the `sktime` Community Council

As a dedicated member of the `sktime` community for over two years, I believe I have contributed to the project in several ways. Some aspects to highlight are:

- **Community Council Member**: Served for approximately 2 years
- **Committee Roles**: Active in Elections and Code of Conduct committees
- **Education & Outreach**: 
  - Co-speaker at ODSC 2023 sktime workshop
  - Contributed new material for time series forecasting presentations
- **Mentorship**: Participated in Google Summer of Code mentee selection panel

Having transitioned from a `sktime` user to an active community member, I have seen the project's evolution and potential and I understand the importance of community contributions in open-source projects. I believe that a thriving community is just as crucial as technical excellence.

If re-elected, I will focus on expanding our community, fostering a welcoming and inclusive environment, advocating for transparent governance, and balancing user needs with project goals to establish our framework as the premier open-source framework and community for time series.

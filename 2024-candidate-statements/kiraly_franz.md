### Vision

I have started `sktime` with an explicit intention to transform how
scientific research in collaboration with end users is done: 

to bring to everyone, in particular those who would otherwise be excluded,
opportunities to participate in, decide on, and benefit from cutting-edge technology.

**With the "AI revolution" on our doorsteps, this vision of participative, open governance is more relevant than ever.**

Global and local gaps in technology capability are growing fast - with power
and benefits becoming concentrated with a handful of countries and individuals.

Knowledge workers are increasingly precarialized and exploited,
and entire regions, even nations, robbed of their technological sovereignty overnight.

To tackle these burning challenges, we need to professionalize, and democratize
governance of the "infrastructure layer" of AI technology that is open source.

This must happen with the support of, and in collaboration with,
societies and economic ecosystems that would otherwise grow dependent on parties
who are neither democratically elected, nor have anything in mind
except their own benefit.

Besides being the main architect of `sktime`, the package, I consider myself among
the few architects of its community, vision, and mission - as well as this
election framework,
which is intended to give meaningful participation opportunities to anyone.

In particular, I intend to ensure support and impact to `sktime`'s mission,
professionalize, and scale it up:

* **open source**, permissive license, free to use
* **openly and transparently governed** by the user and developer community, with a charitable core
* a **friendly, responsive, kind and inclusive community**, with an active commitment to fairness and equal opportunity
* an academically, commercially **neutral space**, with an **ecosystem integration** ambition and neutral point of view
* an **educational platform**, providing mentoring and upskilling for all career stages, especially early career

This, our current vision, is inspired by the revolutionary success of Wikipedia,
and I believe that the same model will be *the* long-term success model for the
infrastructure layer of AI software as well.


### Prior contributions

#### Technology

Together, we have been instrumental in creating the global standard
in time series framework APIs.

Personally, I have contributed to the successful technology strategy,
and I am a frequent contributor to the packages in the ecosystem.

See [my GitHub profile](www.github.com/fkiraly).

The architecture of `sktime` which I have contributed to build makes `sktime`,
to the best of my knowledge, the only major
`sklearn`-like framework which is extensible by anyone,
and composable *across the entire ecosystem*, due to how it manages dependencies
of algorithms, and the non-judgmental algorithm inclusion policy.

This empowers a decentral ecosystem of 2nd and 3rd party extenders, with the innovative
technology architecture closely mirroring the policy of
minimizing projection of control or involuntary dependency relationships.

It is worth pointing out that not even `sklearn` itself has this property,
as it does not handle dependencies on estimator level. While extensible architecturally,
the package manages only algorithms that it "owns" under its very restrictive inclusion
policy, and does not provide visibility to others.


#### Community and governance

Since inception of the project, I have been a key person in community building,
project management, fundraising, inviting people to collaborate,
and building community infrastructure.

Of course there was a lot of collaboration, especially once the project has grown
far beyond my academic research group, over the last years.

Together we have developed what I believe should put us
on good track towards a smooth and professional governance model for
a larger community.

In the future, especially after these elections, I would hope that responsibilities
become more distributed, as more people are willing to step up for the common good.


#### Mentoring

The `sktime` mentoring programme, managed by myself as organisation admin,
has given early career professionals, many from an underrepresented
or discriminated background, opportunities to acquire skills and become visible.

Dozens of mentees have gone on to become successful professionals in the data and AI space,
and a good number are still contributing to `sktime` and its community.


#### Survival and defense of the openly governed model

`sktime` has suffered at least four attempts of takeovers, coups, and,
lately, destruction.
In all of these I have been instrumental in prevention, bulidup of countermeasures,
keeping the community safe and healthy.

Unfortunately, such threats are not surprising,
due to the large value that one could squeeze
out of privatizing the infrastructure. Further, the openly governed model
of `sktime` is widely visible and prototypical, hence a threat to the ideology
that considers open source as successful only if it turns into a company incorporated
in Texas or Delaware, owned by a few male, white, rich American venture capitalists and,
if they are merciful, one or two obedient members of the community.

It has been amazing to see how the community - and, in particular, the current council -
have come together in the face of adversity, showing solidarity and community spirit
beyond what I had thought possible.


#### Adoption of `sktime`, reach of vision

`sktime` is with a large margin the market leader in time series modelling framework packages,
as measured by adoption metrics (downloads, etc).

I see this as a validation of the vision and mission, because:

* `sktime` is the only such package which is openly governed, non-commercial, i.e., not directly or indirectly VC or big tech owned
* `sktime` is the only widely interoperable package, validating the neutral standpoint
* `sktime`'s financial resources are at 0.1% or less of *any* typical competitor

Together, this implies `sktime` is spearheading a successful model for open development,
validating that strength of community and integration with end users
can beat professional influence marketing and dedicated corporate developer teams,
not just easily, but by an astonishingly significant margin.

In the same vein, I am humbled by this silent encouragement of our user community
to remain faithful to our mission.


### Policy

I intend to prioritize what are in my opinion the most effective
ways to progress and scale the mission:

* Organisation platform for `sktime`, incorporation
* Tech: a free marketplace for users and contributors
* AI for all - opportunities and mentoring 


#### Organisation platform for `sktime`, incorporation

I believe the openly governed open source landscape must integrate and professionalize,
in a distributed, mutually supportive, and democratic fashion, in representation
of users, developers, and ultimately wider society.

In terms of goals, this means:

* raising awareness of the economic importance of open source AI infrastructure
  with governments, public sector, and industrial stakeholders
* forming non-profit or charitable incorporation structures to enable contracting,
  management of technological and legal assets, and structures compatible with local jurisdictions
* establishing revenue streams with collaborative, integrative, and support driven value propositions,
  rather than shareholder value proposition geared at exploitation of users of AI software
* develop and iteratively refine effective project management and decision making structures
  for governing the integrated ecosystem

First steps in this direction have already been taken with the incorporation of GC.OS,
a non-profit in Germany (where I hold citizenship), which will support the `sktime`
project (irrespective my status after elections).

Over the coming year, I intend to use this incorporation structure
to broadcast and test value propositions.

With the newly elected council, this will also allow us to resolve
some of the long-standing burning points
around the legal status of the `sktime` project and its assets.

Longer-term, it would be great to help create a decentralized,
resilient ecosystem of mutual support,
with complexity of legal structures increasing as our administrative and
resource capacities grow.


#### Tech: a free marketplace for users and contributors

In the last years, `sktime` has already taken steps to empower
independent developers of compatible plugins or packages.

For instance, it takes minimal effort for a developer of an algorithm or package,
to advertise a compatible plugin in the `sktime` estimator overview.
For external packages, the authors retain intellectual property rights,
control of release pipeline and relevant assets, while being fully discoverable
by users of `sktime` and affiliated packages.

In the end state I envision, the marketplace and its mechanisms must
be at the same time easy to access, maintain neutrality, interoperability,
and be outside the control of any commercial entity - and outside
potential control through coups, corporate legal strategems, and
other adversarial actions. The same should apply to the `sktime` framework itself.

Deep learning models, and especially pre-trained models, pose a new challenge,
both on the technical level and on the legal level (e.g., AI act compliance).
The infrastructure needs to be ready for this new era of modelling as well,
which comes with new opportunities, requirements, competing commercial models,
and threats.

The ambition is to become the "Wikipedia of time series modelling platforms":
neutral, reliable, easy to use, trusted by end users of any kind,
supported by a wide community,
beyond the grasp of shareholder monetization and crazy tech oligarchs.


#### AI for all - opportunities and mentoring

The open source landscape would be nothing without its international contributor and
user base, working together across time zones and borders.

However, when it comes to current trends in monetization and commercialization of
open source AI software,
there are typically only small demographic subsets and certian individuals who reap
the benefits, often forcefully excluding and even expelling others, once a project
reaches noteworthiness, irrespective of merit or ethics.

Cutting-edge knowledge and access to resources such as teaching material
or cloud computing is also often closely guarded or restricted,
leading to systematic discrimination on a global scale.

Similar mechanisms are at play even in supposedly technologically advanced
countries, which may have an AI innovation or capability deficit,
or between different demographics on a local, national or sub-national scale.

A core policy aim of mine will be to use the integrative, virtual operation mode
typical to open source communities to mitigate and reverse these dynamics,
in the scope of the `sktime` project at least, but hopefully even wider.

The mentoring programme and the communities of practice around `sktime` are a natural
entry point that have been effective and growing; this can be scaled as the project
grows further. I have also initiated a few projects related to education,
which will also be of benefit here.

Finally, longer-term, the professionalized governance structure,
incorporations, and collaborative value propositions will
also naturally support any measures in this area.

I look especially forward to work on this with a community that has notably
gained diversity in the last years - I am proud that a small project started in the UK
has now become a truly international endeavour. I am committed to empower -
in the very sense of the word - the unique community that is `sktime`.
